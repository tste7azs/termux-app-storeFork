# Security Policy

Security is a core principle of **Termux App Store**.
This project provides tooling and infrastructure used to build and
validate Termux packages, therefore **supply-chain integrity** and
**trust** are critical.

---

## Supported Versions

Security fixes apply to:
- The `master` branch
- The latest stable release (if applicable)

Older versions may not receive security updates.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report
Choose one of the following:
- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Private contact with the project maintainer

Provide as much detail as possible:
- Description of the issue
- Affected components
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

---

## Response Timeline

We aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within **72 hours**
- Provide an initial assessment within **7 days**
- Release a fix as soon as reasonably possible

Timelines may vary depending on severity.

---

## Automated Security Controls

This repository uses:
- Automated CI validation
- Script & build file linting
- Coverage checks for core tooling
- Controlled GitHub Actions workflows

These measures reduce the risk of:
- Malicious packages
- Hidden build behavior
- Supply-chain attacks

---

## Scope of Security Issues

### In Scope
- Malicious code submissions
- Build script abuse
- CI pipeline manipulation
- Unauthorized data exfiltration
- Dependency or toolchain vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope
- Vulnerabilities in third-party software packaged by users
- User misconfiguration
- Unsupported forks or modified environments

---

## Confidentiality & Disclosure

- All security reports are handled privately
- Public disclosure occurs **only after mitigation**
- Credit will be given to reporters unless anonymity is requested

---

## Zero Tolerance Policy

The following will result in immediate action:
- Intentional backdoors
- Crypto miners
